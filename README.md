An Integrated University Department Information System

Requirements:
University computer science and engineering departments often have budgets which are comparable with small companies and an integrated system to support all aspects of departmental administration is required. This should support student 
records, laboratory administration, the ordering of goods and services, input and output payments, payments made for teaching assistants, research contract reporting, etc. It should be linked to a wider University system responsible for staff salaries etc. Factors which should be taken into account include: 

1) Departmental chairmen who use such a system are usually very busy. Even if they are computer literate, they require a system with a straightforward user interface. 
2) Users of the system range from secretaries through technicians to teaching and administrative staff. The range of users to be supported is very wide. 
3) In some countries, the trend is for Universities is to devolve administration from a central organization to the individual departments. The system must 
be able to be expanded to handle future, unforeseen tasks. 
4)Sub-systems should be automatically linked so that, for example, the costs of a particular class or laboratory can be computed by considering payments made and received.
